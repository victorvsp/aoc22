# Advent of Code 2022 - My Solutions

Repository of my solutions to the problems for advent of code 2022. As always, around Christmas week I fell of track and stopped doing the problems daily. I'm still planning on finishing all problems. Some comments:
- I deleted day 10 by accident before starting to use git. Lesson learned (again).
- Day 16 part 2 "works" but it deserves a lot of optimization. Mainly, pre-processing the graph to transform it into a weighted graph and only keeping the nodes with valves in them will speed things up by a lot.
